The first player is X and second player is O. 
You play by entering coordinates x and y --the program will ask you to enter them. For example, coordinate x= 0 and coordinate y= 0 would show either X or O (depending on which player's turn it is) on the top left corner, or x = 0 and y = 1 would be the center top position, and so on.
The valid numbers to plot the coordinates are 0, 1, and 2.
The game will tell you if you enter an out of range number such as -1, 3, 11, etc.
The game will tell you if you enter an occupied position.
The game will tell you when you've won and which player.
At the end of the game you have to compile again to restart the game.
